  brief: The number of disk reads merged into single physical disk access operations.
  description: The number of disk reads that have been merged into single physical
    disk access operations.  In other words, this metric measures the number of instances
    in which one physical disk access served multiple disk reads.

  brief: The average amount of time it took to do a read operation.
  description: The average amount of time it took to do a read operation.  For Darwin
