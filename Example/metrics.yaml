dimension.frequency:
  brief: Frequency Dimension
  description: "> Frequency Dimension\nThis dimension represents the frequency of\
    \ the sine wave emitted in [gauge.sine](./gauge.sine.md) as a floating point number.\
    \  \nFor transmission, the name and value of this dimension are encoded within\
    \ the value of the `plugin_instance` dimension. This is a demonstration of how\
    \ to transmit additional dimensions to SignalFx. More information can be found\
    \ [here](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html#using-collectd-metrics)."

dimension.host:
  brief: Host Dimension
  description: '> Host Dimension

    This dimension is sent in with all collectd plugins. It will either be what the

    host thinks its hostname is (output of hostname), or the value that has been configured

    to override it in collectd.conf.  More Information can be found [here](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html#using-collectd-metrics).'

dimension.plugin:
  brief: Plugin Dimension
  description: "> plugin\nThis dimension is sent in by all collectd plugins. The value\
    \ of this dimension generally reflects the name of the plugin, but this is up\
    \ to the plugin author.  More information can be found \n[here](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html#using-collectd-metrics).\n\
    This plugin sends the value \"hello-world\"."

dimension.plugin_instance:
  brief: Plugin Instance Dimension
  description: '> Plugin Instance

    This dimension is sent in with most metrics from collectd.  Its meaning varies
    between plugins, but generally indicates which specific data source the metric
    is

    referring to. For example, the plugin `df` uses `plugin_instance` to encode each
    mount point.  You can also use it to encode additional dimensions, as demonstrated
    by [dimension.frequency](./dimension.frequency.md).  More information can be found
    [here](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html#using-collectd-metrics).

    After all decoding is complete, the value of `plugin_instance` for this plugin
    is just "example".'

gauge.sine:
  brief: A sine wave
  description: '> A sine wave

    A sine wave is a curve representing periodic oscillations of constant amplitude

    as given by a sine function.  We send this in as it is a good way to show a

    gauge.'
