gauge.marathon-api-metric:
  brief: Metrics reported by the Marathon Metrics API
  description: '> Metrics reported by the Marathon Metrics API

    The Marathon API offers a set of metrics that are reported by this plugin.

    API Endpoint: `/metrics`

    #### Counters

    This plugin reports all "counters" as `gauge.<metric name>`. The Marathon API
    does the counting for the plugin, so it reads and reports the counts as a gauge
    type value.

    #### Gauges

    This plugin reports all gauge metrics as `gauge.<metric name>`.

    #### Meters

    This plugin reports all metrics listed under "meters" as

    `gauge.<metric name>.<unit>.per.<unit>`.'
