> Frequency Dimension

This dimension represents the frequency of the sine wave emitted in [gauge.sine](./gauge.sine.md) as a floating point number.  

For transmission, the name and value of this dimension are encoded within the value of the `plugin_instance` dimension. This is a demonstration of how to transmit additional dimensions to SignalFx. More information can be found [here](http://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/collectd-info.html#using-collectd-metrics).
