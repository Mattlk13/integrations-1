cpu.utilization:
  brief: Percent of CPU used on this host.
  description: "This metric shows the amount of CPU in use on this machine, as a percent\
    \ of total CPU available. \nThe SignalFx metadata plugin computes this metric\
    \ based on the CPU metrics output by the `aggregation` plugin for collectd or\
    \ the `cpu` plugin for Telegraf. First, compute the ratio of `cpu.idle` to the\
    \ sum of all CPU metrics. Next, subtract that number from 1 to yield the ratio\
    \ of CPU that is not idle, and multiply by 100 to display as percent, as follows:\
    \ \n```\n[1 - cpu.idle / sum(cpu.*)] * 100\n```"
