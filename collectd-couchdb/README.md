### DESCRIPTION

This is the SignalFx couchdb plugin. Follow these instructions to install the couchdb plugin for collectd.

The [couchdb-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchdb) plugin collects metrics from couchdb instances by calling the api endpoint: [stats](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.0/api/server/common.html#stats)

#### FEATURES

#### Built-in dashboards

- **COUCHDB CLUSTER**: Provides a high-level overview of metrics for a single couchdb cluster.

### USAGE

#### Interpreting Built-in dashboards

- **COUCHDB CLUSTER**:

  - **Number of Nodes**: Shows the toal number of active nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-active-nodes.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-active-nodes.png)

  - **Number of Requests**: Shows the total number of requests handled per second by all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-total-requests.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-total-requests.png)

  - **Request Processing Time**: Show the average request processing time of all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-request-time.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-request-time.png)

  - **Database Reads and Writes**: The total number of database reads and writes performed by all the nodes in the cluster.

    [<img src='./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-db-reads-writes.png' width=200px>](./img/chart-couchdb-cluster-db-reads-writes.png)

  - **Active Data Usage**: Shows the active data usage percentage. As the couchdb does only soft deletes, all the deleted records are still present in the database. This chart will indicate the percentage of active data in the database. It is advisable to compact database when the value is below 50%

All metrics reported by the couchdb collectd plugin will contain the following dimensions by default:

* `node`, name of the node as in the cluster
* `cluster`, human readable cluster name


A few other details:

* `plugin` is always set to `couchdb`
* `plugin_instance` will contain the IP address and the port of the member given in the configuration
* To add enhanced metrics, use the configuration options mentioned in [configuration](#configuration).
