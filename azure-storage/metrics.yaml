  title: SuccessE2ELatency
  metric_type:
  brief: Success E2E Latency
  description: The average end-to-end latency of successful requests made to a storage
    service or the specified API operation, in milliseconds. This value includes the

Availability:
  title: Availability
  metric_type:
  brief: Availability
  description: The percentage of availability for the storage service or the specified
    API operation. Availability is calculated by taking the TotalBillableRequests
    value and dividing it by the number of applicable requests, including those that
    produced unexpected errors. All unexpected errors result in reduced availability
    for the storage service or the specified API operation.
