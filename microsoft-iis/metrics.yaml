gauge.process.handle_count:
  brief: The total number of handles currently open by this process. This number is
    equal to the sum of the handles currently open by each thread in this process.

gauge.process.id_process:
  brief: The unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused, so
    they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.

gauge.process.pct_processor_time:
  brief: The percentage of elapsed time that all process threads used the processor
    to execution instructions. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and
    trap conditions are included in this count.

    cannot be shared with other processes.

gauge.process.virtual_bytes:
  brief: The current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using.
    Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either
    disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit
    its ability to load libraries.

gauge.process.working_set:
  brief: The current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working
    Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process.
    If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working
    Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold,
    pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed, they will then be soft-faulted
    back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.
