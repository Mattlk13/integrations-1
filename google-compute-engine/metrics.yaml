  brief: CPU usage
  description: Delta CPU usage for all cores, in seconds. To compute the per-core
    CPU utilization fraction, divide this value by (end-start)*N, where end and start
    define this value's time interval and N is `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores`
    at the end of the interval. This value is reported by the hypervisor for the VM
    and can differ from `agent.googleapis.com/cpu/usage_time`, which is reported from
    inside the VM.
