cpu.idle:
  brief: CPU time spent not in any other state
  custom: true
  description: CPU time spent not in any other state. In order to get a percentage
    this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states.
  metric_type: cumulative
  title: cpu.idle

cpu.interrupt:
  brief: CPU time spent while servicing hardware interrupts
  custom: true
  description: CPU time spent while servicing hardware interrupts. A hardware interrupt
    happens at the physical layer. When this occurs, the CPU will stop whatever else
    it is doing and service the interrupt. This metric measures how many jiffies were
    spent handling these interrupts. In order to get a percentage this value must
    be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this
    metric may be caused by faulty hardware such as a broken peripheral.

cpu.nice:
  brief: CPU time spent in userspace running 'nice'-ed processes
  custom: true
  description: 'CPU time spent in userspace running ''nice''-ed processes. In order
    to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states.
    A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) The server not having
    enough CPU capacity for a process, 2) A programming error which causes a process
    to use an unexpected amount of CPU'

cpu.softirq:
  brief: CPU time spent while servicing software interrupts
  custom: true
  description: CPU time spent while servicing software interrupts. Unlike a hardware
    interrupt, a software interrupt happens at the sofware layer. Usually it is a
    userspace program requesting a service of the kernel. This metric measures how
    many jiffies were spent by the CPU handling these interrupts. In order to get
    a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. A
    sustained high value for this metric may be caused by a programming error which
    causes a process to unexpectedly request too many services from the kernel.

cpu.steal:
  brief: CPU time spent waiting for a hypervisor to service requests from other virtual
    machines
  custom: true
  description: 'CPU time spent waiting for a hypervisor to service requests from other
    virtual machines. This metric is only present on virtual machines. This metric
    records how much time this virtual machine had to wait to have the hypervisor
    kernel service a request. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared
    against the sum of all CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may
    be caused by: 1) Another VM on the same hypervisor using too many resources, or
    2) An underpowered hypervisor'

cpu.system:
  brief: CPU time spent running in the kernel
  custom: true
  description: 'CPU time spent running in the kernel. This value reflects how often
    processes are calling into the kernel for services (e.g to log to the console).
    In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against the sum of all
    CPU states. A sustained high value for this metric may be caused by: 1) A process
    that needs to be re-written to use kernel resources more efficiently, or 2) A
    userspace driver that is broken'

cpu.user:
  brief: CPU time spent running in userspace
  custom: true
  description: 'CPU time spent running in userspace. In order to get a percentage
    this value must be compared against the sum of all CPU states. If this value is
    high: 1) A process requires more CPU to run than is available on the server, or
    2) There is an application programming error which is causing the CPU to be used
    unexpectedly.'

cpu.wait:
  brief: Amount of total CPU time spent idle while waiting for an I/O operation to
    complete
  custom: true
  description: 'Amount of total CPU time spent idle while waiting for an I/O operation
    to complete. In order to get a percentage this value must be compared against
    the sum of all CPU states. A high value for a sustained period may be caused by:
    1) A slow hardware device that is taking too long to service requests, or 2) Too
    many requests being sent to an I/O device'
