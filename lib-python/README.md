### DESCRIPTION

<code>signalfx-python</code> is a programmatic interface in Python for SignalFx's metadata and ingest APIs. It is meant to provide a base for communicating with SignalFx APIs that can be easily leveraged by scripts and applications to interact with SignalFx or report metric and event data to SignalFx. It is also the base for metric reporters that integrate with common Python-based metric collections tools or libraries.


### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

#### Python version

Python 2.7.9 or higher is recommended. If you are not making API calls to interact with SignalFx metadata, then you need only use Python 2.6.9 or higher.

#### API access token

To use this library, you need a SignalFx API access
token. <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.signalfx.com/docs/authentication">Click here for more information on retrieving your API token</a>.

### INSTALLATION

To install from pip:

```
sudo pip install signalfx
```

To install from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-python.git
cd signalfx-python
python setup.py install
```


### USAGE

#### Sending metrics

The core function of the library is to send metric data to SignalFx. For example:

```python
import signalfx

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('MY_TOKEN')
sfx.send(
    gauges=[
      {'metric': 'myfunc.time',
       'value': 532,
       'timestamp': 1442960607000},
      ...
    ],
    counters=[
      {'metric': 'myfunc.calls',
       'value': 42,
       'timestamp': 1442960607000},
      ...
    ],
    cumulative_counters=[
      {'metric': 'myfunc.calls_cumulative',
       'value': 10,
       'timestamp': 1442960607000},
      ...
    ])

# After all datapoints have been sent, flush any
# remaining messages in the send queue and terminate
# all connections

sfx.stop()
```

The `timestamp` must be a millisecond precision timestamp; the number of milliseconds elapsed since Epoch. The `timestamp` field is optional, but strongly recommended. If not specified, it will be set by SignalFx's ingest servers automatically; in this situation, the timestamp of your datapoints will not accurately represent the time of their measurement (network latency, batching, etc. will all impact when those datapoints actually make it to SignalFx).

When sending datapoints with multiple calls to `send()`, you should re-use the same SignalFx client object for each `send()` call.

If you must use multiple client objects for the same token, which is not recommended, it is important to call `stop()` after making all `send()` calls. Each SignalFx client object uses a background thread to send datapoints without blocking the caller. Calling `stop()` will gracefully flush the thread's send queue and close its TCP connections.

#### Sending multi-dimensional metrics

The SignalFx data format includes the concept of dimensions. Time series dimensions are custom key/value pairs in combination with the metric name that identify the metric time series. Dimensions are also useful in aggregating and filtering metrics. For example, sending an "environment" dimension with each datapoint would allow you to vary alerts based on the different environments that metrics are being sent from.

Reporting dimensions for the data can be accomplished by specifying a `dimensions` parameter on each datapoint containing a dictionary of string to string key/value pairs representing the dimensions:

```python
import signalfx

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('MY_TOKEN')
sfx.send(
    gauges=[
      {
        'metric': 'myfunc.time',
        'value': 532,
        'timestamp': 1442960607000,
        'dimensions': {'host': 'server1', 'host_ip': '1.2.3.4'}
      },
      ...
    ], ...)
sfx.stop()
```

See <a target="_blank" href="examples/generic_usecase.py">examples/generic_usecase.py</a> for a
complete code sample showing how to send data to SignalFx.

#### Sending events

Events can be sent to SignalFx via the `send_event` function. The event type must be specified, and dimensions and extra event properties can be supplied as well.

```python
import signalfx

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('MY_TOKEN')
sfx.send_event(
    event_type='deployments',
    dimensions={
        'host': 'myhost',
        'service': 'myservice',
        'instance': 'myinstance'},
    properties={
        'version': '2015.04.29-01'})
```

See `examples/generic_usecase.py` for a complete code example.

#### Metric metadata

The library includes functions that search, get, and update metric dimensions, properties and tags.  Deleting tags is also supported.

```python
import signalfx

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('MY_TOKEN')
sfx.update_tag('some_tag_name',
                description='an example tag',
                custom_properties={'version':'some_number'})
```

#### AWS integration

Optionally, the client may be configured to append additional dimensions to all metrics and events sent to SignalFx. One use case for this is to append the <a target="_blank" href="https://signalfx-product-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/integrations/aws-info.html#uniquely-identifying-aws-instances">AWS unique ID</a> of the current host as an extra dimension. For example:

```python
import signalfx
from signalfx.aws import AWS_ID_DIMENSION, get_aws_unique_id

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('your_api_token')
sfx.add_dimensions({AWS_ID_DIMENSION: get_aws_unique_id()})
sfx.send(
    gauges=[
      {
        'metric': 'myfunc.time',
        'value': 532,
        'timestamp': 1442960607000
        'dimensions': {'host': 'server1', 'host_ip': '1.2.3.4'}
      },
    ])
sfx.stop()
```

#### PyFormance reporter

`pyformance` is a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/omergertel/pyformance">Python library</a> that provides <a target="_blank" href="http://metrics.codahale.com/">CodaHale</a>-style metrics in a very Pythonic way. We offer a reporter that can report the `pyformance` metric registry data directly to SignalFx.

```python
from pyformance import count_calls, gauge
import signalfx.pyformance

@count_calls
def callme():
    # whatever
    pass

sfx = signalfx.pyformance.SignalFxReporter(api_token='MY_TOKEN')
sfx.start()

callme()
callme()
gauge('test').set_value(42)
...
```

See `examples/pyformance_usecase.py` for a complete code example using PyFormance.

### KNOWN ISSUES

#### Sending only 1 datapoint and not seeing it in the chart

The Python client library is mainly targeted towards sending a continuous stream of metrics, and was implemented to be asynchronous. As a result, short-lived scripts that exit right after calling the send method (as can be the case if your script is sending just one datapoint) may not yield a datapoint in a chart on the SignalFx service.

To work around this problem, register an `atexit` function to cleanly stop the datapoint sending thread when your program exits:

```python
import atexit
import signalfx

sfx = signalfx.SignalFx('MY_TOKEN')
atexit.register(sfx.stop)
```

#### SSLError when working with tags, metrics, dimensions, metrictimeseries, organization

```
ERROR:root:Posting to SignalFx failed.
SSLError: hostname 'api.signalfx.com' doesn't match either of
'*.signalfuse.com', 'signalfuse.com'.
```

SignalFx's API endpoint (https://api.signalfx.com) has SSL SNI enabled and the `urllib3` module in Python versions prior to 2.7.8 had a bug that causes the above issue. This was fixed in later versions of Python; we recommend using Python 2.7.9 or newer when using this library.
