### gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.Read.Latency.50thPercentile

50th percentile (median) of Cassandra read latency. This value should
be similar across all nodes in the cluster. If some nodes have higher
values than the rest of the cluster then they may have more connected
clients or may be experiencing heavier than usual compaction load.
