### counter.cassandra.ClientRequest.RangeSlice.Timeouts.Count

Count of range slice timeouts since server start. This typically indicates a server overload condition.

If this value is increasing across the cluster then the cluster is too small for the application range slice load.

If this value is increasing for a single server in a cluster, then one of the following conditions may be true:
- one or more clients are directing more load to this server than the others
- the server is experiencing hardware or software issues and may require maintenance.
