### gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.Read.Latency.99thPercentile

99th percentile of Cassandra read latency. This value should be similar
across all nodes in the cluster. If some nodes have higher values than
the rest of the cluster then they may have more connected clients or
may be experiencing heavier than usual compaction load.
