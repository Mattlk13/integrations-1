### gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.RangeSlice.Latency.99thPercentile

99th percentile of Cassandra range slice latency. This value should be
similar across all nodes in the cluster. If some nodes have higher values than
the rest of the cluster then they may have more connected clients or may be
experiencing heavier than usual compaction load.
