### gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.Write.Latency.99thPercentile

99th percentile of Cassandra write latency. This value should be
similar across all nodes in the cluster. If some nodes have higher
values than the rest of the cluster then they may have more connected
clients or may be experiencing heavier than usual compaction load.
